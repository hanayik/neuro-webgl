# Niivue Docs

These docs are automatically generated during each build and deployed using Github pages.

## Live demo

The live demo exists to show off Niivue in its current state. This is sort of like working with the garage door open. The `master` branch features and capabilities will be shown here. Sometimes demos may look odd when new features are being tested incrementally.
